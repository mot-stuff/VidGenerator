# SaaS Processing-as-a-Service Model

## 🎯 **Your Vision: File Processing Service**

### User Flow
1. **User logs in** → Sees their dashboard with usage stats
2. **User uploads video file(s)** → Temporary storage for processing
3. **User enters text or uploads CSV** → Content for TTS generation
4. **User clicks "Generate"** → Your AI pipeline processes everything
5. **User downloads finished video** → File gets deleted from your servers
6. **User gets charged** → Based on processing time or video count

### Key Benefits of This Model
✅ **Lower storage costs** - Files are temporary (1-7 days max)
✅ **No content moderation headaches** - Users responsible for their uploads
✅ **Clear value proposition** - "AI video processing service"
✅ **Simpler compliance** - No permanent user content storage
✅ **Predictable costs** - Processing power, not storage scaling

## 🏗️ **Simplified Architecture**

```
User Dashboard → Upload Videos → AI Processing → Download Results
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Authentication → Temp Storage → TTS + Captions → Auto-Delete
     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
Usage Tracking → File Validation → Video Export → Billing Update
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### Simplified File Flow
```python
# 1. User uploads video
@app.post("/api/upload")
async def upload_video(user: User, video: UploadFile):
    # Save to user's temp directory
    temp_path = f"temp/{user.id}/{uuid4()}/{video.filename}"
    # Set expiration: 7 days from now
    schedule_deletion(temp_path, days=7)
    return {"file_id": file_id, "temp_path": temp_path}

# 2. User starts processing
@app.post("/api/process")
async def process_video(user: User, request: ProcessRequest):
    # Check user's quota
    if not has_quota(user.id):
        raise HTTPException(402, "Quota exceeded")
    
    # Queue processing job
    job = queue_video_processing.delay(
        user_id=user.id,
        video_path=request.video_path,
        text=request.text,
        settings=request.settings
    )
    
    # Increment usage
    increment_user_usage(user.id)
    return {"job_id": job.id, "status": "processing"}

# 3. Background processing
@celery.task
def queue_video_processing(user_id, video_path, text, settings):
    try:
        # Your existing video processing logic
        result = compose_video_with_tts(
            video_path=video_path,
            text=text,
            **settings
        )
        
        # Move to user's download folder (temp, 7-day expiry)
        download_path = f"downloads/{user_id}/{uuid4()}/result.mp4"
        shutil.move(result, download_path)
        schedule_deletion(download_path, days=7)
        
        # Notify user (optional: email/webhook)
        notify_user_completion(user_id, download_path)
        
        return {"status": "completed", "download_url": download_path}
    except Exception as e:
        # Refund user's quota on failure
        decrement_user_usage(user_id)
        raise

# 4. User downloads result
@app.get("/api/download/{file_id}")
async def download_result(user: User, file_id: str):
    # Verify file belongs to user and exists
    file_path = get_user_file(user.id, file_id)
    return FileResponse(file_path)
```

### Storage Strategy
```python
# File organization
user_uploads/
├── {user_id}/
│   ├── processing/     # Current jobs
│   ├── downloads/      # Completed videos (7-day expiry)
│   └── temp/          # Upload staging (24-hour expiry)

# Automatic cleanup
@celery.task
def cleanup_expired_files():
    """Run daily to clean up expired user files"""
    # Delete files older than their expiry date
    # Free up storage space
    # Update database records
```

## 📊 **Technical Requirements**

### Infrastructure Needs
```yaml
# Minimal setup for 100 concurrent users
App Server: 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM ($20/month)
Processing Workers: 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM ($40/month) 
Database: PostgreSQL managed ($15/month)
Redis Cache: 1GB ($10/month)
File Storage: 100GB temporary ($5/month)
Total: ~$90/month
```

### Scaling Considerations
- **CPU-intensive**: Video processing needs powerful workers
- **Temporary storage**: Much cheaper than permanent file hosting
- **Auto-scaling**: Spin up workers based on queue length
- **Geographic**: Process files close to users (multi-region later)

## 🎯 **Business Model Advantages**

### Lower Operating Costs
- **No permanent storage** - files deleted after download
- **Predictable processing costs** - CPU time vs storage time
- **Easier compliance** - no long-term user data retention

### Clearer Value Proposition
- **"Upload raw video, get back AI-enhanced shorts"**
- **Processing time comparison**: Manual editing (2 hours) vs AI service (5 minutes)
- **Cost comparison**: Video editor ($50/hour) vs AI service ($1/video)

### Reduced Legal Risk
- **Users own content** - you're just processing it
- **No content moderation** - users responsible for uploads
- **Clear terms** - "temporary processing service"

## 💡 **Competitive Advantages**

### Unique Features You Could Add
1. **Batch Processing**: Upload 10 videos, process all at once
2. **Custom Branding**: Add user logos/watermarks during processing
3. **Multiple Formats**: Output same content in different aspect ratios
4. **Voice Consistency**: Remember user's preferred TTS voice
5. **Template Library**: Pre-made caption styles and animations

### Premium Features
- **Priority Processing**: Paid users get faster queue priority
- **HD Output**: Higher quality exports for premium tiers
- **API Access**: Let power users integrate with their tools
- **Webhook Notifications**: Alert users when processing completes
- **Bulk Download**: ZIP multiple processed videos
